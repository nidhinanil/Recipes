    <h2><em>What is Naan</em></h2>
    <p><em><strong>Naan is a leavened flatbread made in some countries in Asia. These breads are baked in a tandoor (a cylindrical oven made of clay). It is also popular in India and is served in almost all the restaurants here.</strong></em></p>
    <p><em>Though naan is not made in Indian homes as a staple. It is roti or chapati (unleavened flatbread made from whole wheat flour) that is made on a regular basis.</em></p>
    <p><em>Naan is such a delish bread that it makes you forget about all-purpose flour.</em></p>
      
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>

        <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>

        <li>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>

        <li>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
